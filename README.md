Brutus is a repository of the high-fidelity captures from Google's Brutus light field video rig. We are making these available to the research community with the hope that they can be played back in real time in a VR headset -- and in the process, to build a free and open-source tool for light field video for VR.

The Brutus rig records light field video with an array of twenty-four Z CAM E2 cinema cameras, each recording synchronized at 4K resolution.  The cameras are evenly distributed across a 180-degree hemisphere, running at 60 frames per second.  Each camera records a 190 degree field of view with a six point five millimeter Meike (‘may-kee’) micro four thirds lens.

The placement and field of view of the cameras is designed to sample the rays of light needed to create an immersive experience – of sitting across from a live performance, with the ability to move both your head position and rotation as if you were really there.
